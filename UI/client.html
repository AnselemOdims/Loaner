                                Most personal loans carry fixed rates, which means your rate and monthly payments (sometimes called installments) stay the same for the life of the loan.
                                Fixed-rate loans make sense if you want consistent payments each month and if you’re concerned about rising rates on long-term loans. Having a fixed rate makes it easier to budget, as you don’t have to worry about your payments changing.
